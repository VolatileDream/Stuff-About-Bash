# File Systems

 1) Provide unix commands to do the following tasks, remember that the file names have been constructed maliciously.

   a) Print the non-hidden files in the "file system" directory.

   b) Print the contents of each of the files in the "file system" directory.

 2) Why does "file system/broken-script" have a mis match between the number of arguments and files that it prints out? Fix it to correctly count the number of files that are in the current directory.
