# Stuff-About-Bash

Some things you didn't know about bash, and exercises to aid with learning.

## Topics

This is a continuation of the Unix10X series of seminars that cover the use of *nix environments, largely through interacting with a command line shell. In
this instalment we will be covering some of what the School of Computer Science has left out of their introduction to the Command Line / Bash (from cs246), as well as a brief introduction to having a useful prompt.

Topics to be discussed include:
 * Fancy Bash: paren expansion, arrays, and some shopt
 * The File System is Scary: your file names contain white space and newlines.
 * Where Am I: A brief introduction to prompt customization
